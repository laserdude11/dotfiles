Laserswald's Dotfiles
=====================

You need GNU Stow in order to install these. Just put these in a subdirectory of ~, go into that directory and execute

    stow [packages]

for any package you want.

Special thanks goes to:
    arcetera for his ideas on how to structure my files.
    z3bra and dcat for being general badasses and making wmutils.

I really don't give a fuck.
